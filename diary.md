# Diary

## Day 1: 5th December 2021

- The development Environment was set up: VS-CODE, node.js, Git, Github, and additional tools such as Bracket Pairm and Prettier.

- I learnt about scss which works as a wrapper to implement CSS in projects.

- A basic "Hello World" application was coded, and a repository in github was created.
