# Diary

## Day 1: 5th December 2021

- The development Environment was set up: VS-CODE, node.js, Git, Github, and additional tools such as Bracket Pairm and Prettier.
- I learnt about scss which works as a wrapper to implement CSS in projects.
- A basic "Hello World" application was coded, and a repository in github was created.

## Day 2: 6th December 2021

- I started the first html page (index.html)
- I initiated to learn about styling on the htlm page using different elements the body of html. For instance I learn how to tag via "id" the html file in the css page, and provide features using the main.scss file. I learnt to make function in css, manipulate the opacity of the background, change the font, and font colors. I also learnt how to add icons and add transitions.

## Day 3: 12th December 2021

- I learnt to separate the main.scss file in serveral ones, additionally to call them: one for functions, and the other for specific functionalities. Also how to select DOM elements using javascript.
  New javascript functions were presented such as transpose and translate.

## Day 4: 19th December 2021

- create functions to adjust automatically the color
  and function to adjust the components when the screen has less resolution in "\_mobile.scss"
  I started to give some personalization to the project, my idea is create a front-web page, not as portafolio, but for AI
  desktop app I am developing in my studies related to parse tables as CSV from pdfs.

## Day 5: 26th December 2021

- I started to learn the grid, flexbox or how to organize the components in the space.
- I added more personalization: I modified the elements in texsum.html including:
  possibility to upload documents and use keywords to search text (notice that these frontend functionalities
  are not connected to any database or local folder at the moment, but in the future they will be implemented-)

## Day 6: 8 January

- I added more personalization: I modified the elements in textract.html including:
  possibility to upload documents and use keywords to search text (notice that these frontend functionalities
  are not connected to any database or local folder at the moment, but in the future will be enabled)

## Day 7: 15 January

- I implemented the contact page using flexbox using similar functionalities from previos pages.

## Day 8: 23 January

- I learnt to deploy the application to github. First I need to install gh-pages, and modify package.json,
  specificially adding "homepage" with the address in the github repository, starting with username.github.io/name_of_the_repository.
  Also it is necesaary to specify the directory to be updloaded using "deploy": gh-pages -d "directory"
